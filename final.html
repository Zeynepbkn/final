    Members: Eren Ulu, Fırat Akba 1. Introduction Efficient inventory management
    is a critical challenge, especially for businesses dealing with large
    volumes of perishable goods, such as retail, food, and pharmaceutical
    industries. Stock mismanagement, deterioration of products, and expiration
    date oversight can lead to significant financial losses and a decline in
    customer trust. This project aims to develop a system that automates stock
    tracking and quality control by leveraging computer vision and machine
    learning. Through stock tracking and image recognition, we will monitor
    defective or nearly expired products, assess product quality, track the
    level of deterioration, and eliminate the need for manual processes.
    Additionally, by integrating historical sales data, we will implement
    forecasting algorithms to optimize inventory levels and reduce wastage. Our
    approach seeks to offer businesses a modern, AI-driven solution that
    enhances accuracy in stock management, minimizes product spoilage through
    tracking level of deterioration via image recognition, and streamlines the
    decision-making process for reordering inventory. 2. Problem Statement
    Manual stock tracking and quality monitoring can be inefficient, leading to
    errors, product waste, and stock mismanagement. These inefficiencies can
    negatively impact business operations, especially in industries dealing with
    foods. Furthermore, expiration date management and defect detection are
    often overlooked or inaccurately assessed, resulting in potential financial
    losses and reduced customer trust. 3. Objectives The main objectives of this
    project are: • To automate the stock tracking process. • To develop a system
    that can measure product deterioration and defects from images, enabling
    accurate quality monitoring. • To track and monitor product expiration
    dates. • To utilize historical sales data to optimize forecasting and
    improve inventory decision-making. 4. Scope This project will focus on the
    following core areas: • Stock Tracking: Real-time monitoring of product
    availability and stock levels using image recognition. • Product Quality
    Control: Analyzing product images to detect signs of wear, defects. •
    Deterioration Level Tracking: Analyzing the level of deterioration using an
    image recognition machine learning model. • Expiration Date Monitoring:
    Using computer vision to recognize expiration dates on product packaging and
    flagging items nearing expiration. • Inventory Forecasting: Leveraging
    historical sales data and machine learning algorithms to forecast future
    stock needs and optimize reordering processes. 5. Methodology To achieve the
    project goals, the following steps will be undertaken: 1. Dataset: We will
    gather a dataset of product images in various conditions, including normal,
    deteriorated, and defective items. The dataset will include images of
    packaging with visible expiration dates. 2. Machine Learning Models: ◦ Image
    Recognition: We will use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual
    analysis of product images to detect defects, deterioration level and
    identify expiration dates. Transfer learning may be applied to pre-trained
    models like ResNet or MobileNet to enhance both speed and accuracy. ◦ Sales
    Data Analysis: Time-series forecasting will be in the format of CNN for
    future prediction. 3. System Design: The system will be divided into the
    following modules: ◦ Stock Tracking Module: Tracks the products to update
    stock levels automatically. ◦ Quality Monitoring Module: Evaluates product
    conditions based on visual analysis, checking for defects. ◦ Deterioration
    Level Tracking: Analyzing the level of deterioration using an image
    recognition machine learning model. ◦ Forecasting Module: Analyzes sales
    data to predict future stock requirements. 4. Implementation: The system
    will be developed using Python and PyTorch for machine learning models, and
    a suitable web framework for the user interface. The database will store
    both stock information and historical sales data for future analysis. 6.
    Expected Outcomes The final system is expected to deliver the following
    outcomes: • A fully functional stock tracking system. • An accurate image
    recognition-based product quality monitoring tool capable of detecting
    deterioration and defects of food. • An expiration date tracking feature to
    flag products nearing expiration. • An optimized inventory forecasting
    system to reduce over-stocking or under-stocking issues. 7. Tools and
    Technologies • Programming Languages: Python, Java • Frameworks: PyTorch,
    React, SpringBoot • Libraries: OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Pandas • Machine
    Learning Models: CNNs, Time-Series Forecasting • Database: PostgreSQL -
    NoSQL 8. Summary Our project proposes an innovative solution to automate
    stock management and quality control through image recognition and machine
    learning. This system will streamline inventory tracking, improve product
    quality monitoring, and provide accurate forecasting capabilities. It holds
    significant potential for various industries, particularly those managing
    perishable goods. Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the practical
    application of AI in solving real-world business challenges.
